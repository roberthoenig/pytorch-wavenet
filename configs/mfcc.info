mfcc behaves like a convolution: winlen <-> kernel_size, winstep <-> stride
this means that we can reverse mfcc with respect to the input shape with a transposed
convolution that takes parameters (kernel_size=winlen, winstep=stride)
it also means that the input should have a length that is a multiple of stride, since otherwise,
the filters created by mfcc won't cover all input values.
